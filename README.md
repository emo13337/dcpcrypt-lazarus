### Encrypting a Message

```pascal
var
  Cipher: TDCP_rijndael;
  EncryptedData: String;
begin
  Cipher := TDCP_rijndael.Create(nil);
  try
    Cipher.Init(Key, Length(Key)*8, InitializationVector);
    Cipher.EncryptString(InputMessage, EncryptedData);
  finally
    Cipher.Free;
  end;
end;
```

### Decrypting Data

```pascal
var
  Cipher: TDCP_rijndael;
  DecryptedData: String;
begin
  Cipher := TDCP_rijndael.Create(nil);
  try
    Cipher.Init(Key, Length(Key)*8, InitializationVector);
    Cipher.DecryptString(EncryptedData, DecryptedData);
  finally
    Cipher.Free;
  end;
end;
```

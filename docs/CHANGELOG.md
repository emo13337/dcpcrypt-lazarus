- Version number bumped to 2.0.6
- Added console demo example:
  - `examples/console/demo_hash_large_file.lpr`: Large file hashing (>5 GB) with real-time progress (%, MB/s, elapsed time), manual `Hash.Update()` loop with 64 KB blocks to avoid `UpdateStream` integer overflow, `--size=N` and `--dir=path` options, robust error handling
- Added `{$MODE Delphi}` directive to `dcpbase64.pas` and `dcpconst.pas` (were the only units missing it, making `-Mdelphi` command-line flag no longer required)
- Switched all 4 console examples from `{$MODE Delphi}` to `{$MODE ObjFPC}{$H+}`
- Switched all GUI example files from `{$MODE Delphi}` to `{$MODE ObjFPC}{$H+}`
- Removed `-Mdelphi` from Makefile example build flags
